#+title: frame-workflow.el: Per-Frame Workflow on Emacs

[[https://travis-ci.org/akirak/frame-workflow.svg?branch=master]]

=Frame-workflow.el= lets you define and organize per-frame workflow for Emacs. This is yet another workspace solution such as eyebrowse, perspective, and framegroups. It is frame-oriented and supports frame-specific states and actions. It is also designed to integrate with [[https://github.com/alphapapa/frame-purpose.el][frame-purpose.el]] which lets you focus on particular things inside a frame.

* Installation
This package requires Emacs 25.1.

The package is not available on MELPA at present, but it may be added in the future. Clone the repository and add the directory to =load-path=.

It depends on the following packages. You have to install them as well:

- [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash.el]]
- [[https://github.com/alphapapa/frame-purpose.el][frame-purpose.el]] if you use an integration with the package
